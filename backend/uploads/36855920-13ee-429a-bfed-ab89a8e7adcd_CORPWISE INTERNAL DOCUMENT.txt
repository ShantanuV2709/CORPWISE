--------------------------------------------------
1. COMPANY OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

CORPWISE Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is an enterprise software company focused on building
AI-driven internal intelligence platforms for organizations. The company specializes
in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), knowledge management systems, and secure
enterprise AI solutions.

The primary goal of CORPWISE is to help organizations access, understand, and trust
their internal data using AI without compromising accuracy, privacy, or compliance.

--------------------------------------------------
2. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------

CORPWISE operates with a modular team structure:

- Engineering Team
  Responsible for backend services, AI orchestration, retrieval pipelines, and
  system reliability.

- Product Team
  Defines feature requirements, user experience flows, and release planning.

- Data & AI Team
  Manages document ingestion, embeddings, vector databases, model evaluation,
  and quality monitoring.

- Operations Team
  Handles deployment, monitoring, access control, and cost optimization.

--------------------------------------------------
3. DAILY OPERATIONS WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------

Daily operations at CORPWISE follow a structured workflow:

1. Internal documents are ingested into the system via controlled pipelines.
2. Documents are stored in a secure database with metadata such as department,
   access level, and version.
3. Embeddings are generated and stored in the vector database.
4. User queries are processed through:
   - Keyword-based retrieval
   - Semantic retrieval
   - Re-ranking and confidence scoring
5. Responses are generated only when sufficient grounding is available.
6. All interactions are logged for auditing and quality improvement.

--------------------------------------------------
4. DATA ACCESS & SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------

Data security is a core principle at CORPWISE.

- All internal documents are access-controlled based on user roles.
- Retrieval is filtered at query time to ensure users only see authorized content.
- External language models are gated and used only when internal data is sufficient.
- Sensitive data is never exposed directly to users.

--------------------------------------------------
5. QUALITY CONTROL & VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------

CORPWISE enforces strict quality checks on AI-generated responses:

- Answers must be grounded in internal documents.
- Source attribution is mandatory for high-confidence responses.
- Confidence scores are calculated based on retrieval agreement.
- Low-confidence answers are flagged or withheld.

User feedback is collected to identify retrieval failures, outdated documents,
or unclear responses.

--------------------------------------------------
6. RESPONSE CACHING POLICY
--------------------------------------------------

To optimize performance and cost:

- Only high-confidence responses are cached.
- Cached responses are invalidated when underlying documents change.
- Context-dependent or personalized answers are never cached.

--------------------------------------------------
7. INCIDENT HANDLING
--------------------------------------------------

In case of incorrect or misleading responses:

1. The incident is logged automatically.
2. The affected query and retrieved documents are reviewed.
3. Documents may be updated or re-embedded.
4. Confidence thresholds are adjusted if required.

--------------------------------------------------
8. COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE
--------------------------------------------------

CORPWISE aligns with enterprise compliance requirements:

- Audit logs are maintained for all queries and responses.
- Document versioning is enforced.
- Access reviews are conducted periodically.

--------------------------------------------------
9. FUTURE DIRECTION
--------------------------------------------------

The company plans to expand CORPWISE into a full enterprise AI operating system,
supporting multiple departments, tenants, and compliance frameworks.

Upcoming focus areas include:
- Advanced evaluation metrics
- Feedback-driven learning
- Role-aware response personalization
- Cross-department knowledge synthesis
